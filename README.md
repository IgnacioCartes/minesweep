# minesweep
Simple Minesweeper game for mobile devices.

## Why?

Honestly this was mostly an excercise to learn how to fully develop a mobile application using nothing but JavaScript (and a bit of HTML and CSS I guess). Just a for-fun project, really.

This has been developed in vanilla JavaScript only, and eventually built using Cocoon.io.

This has a lot of "reinventing the wheel", specially when it comes to using a game framework I'm developing (hyne), instead of using one of the many great ones available, such as Phaser or Enchant. But again, working on that framework is part of my "learning" experience.

## To-do

* Create confirmation menus for the "restart" and "exit" buttons
* Add sound effects
* Implement a nice transition between both scenes ("select" and "play") (now its just an abrupt change of scenes)
* Maybe make a more interesting background for the "select difficulty" scene
